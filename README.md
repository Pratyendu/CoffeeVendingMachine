# Coffee Machine Simulator
This is a simple Coffee Machine Simulator implemented in Java. It is a console application that allows users to buy different types of coffee, fill the machine with ingredients, take money from the machine, show the remaining ingredients, and see the analytics of the machine.




## Features

- Coffee Machine can hold infinite amounts of ingredients - milk, water, and coffee beans.
- Coffee Machine can sell three different types of coffee: Espresso, Latte, and Cappuccino, with separate prices and amounts of ingredients required.
- The user can buy a coffee of their choice, and the coffee will be dispensed only if the machine has enough ingredients to make that coffee.
- After dispensing the coffee, the money in the machine's box will be updated, and the remaining ingredients will be updated as well.
- The user can fill the machine with ingredients as per their choice.
- The user can take money from the machine.
- The user can show the remaining ingredients in the machine.
- The user can see the analytics of the machine, which includes the count of all the coffees sold, the amount earned, and the ingredients consumed.
